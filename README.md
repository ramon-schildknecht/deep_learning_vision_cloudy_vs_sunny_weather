# Project: Deep Learning in Vision Classificate Sunny vs. Cloudy Weather

## Goal
Meet Alexa. She is so excited! She will solve several classifying problems like differentiate between sunny and cloudy images, lake and mountains, holiday countries like United States of America and China … At the end of her project she made a important lesson: Alone the classification of the sunny and cloudy pictures was very time consuming.  


## Results
Performed several deep learning models to differentiate between sunny and cloudy pictues. Alexa tested Convolutional Nets as well to see which areas of the pictures are most relevant for classification. She used transfer learning models as well. Finally Alexa performed Mask R-CNNs to define objects within a picture with a suitable visual object frame. Enjoy the results in the "__Jupyter Notebook Object Detection Tag Sunny vs. Cloudy__.ipynb" as well as in "./results/Deep Learning in Vision Assignment  «Crazy Picture Predictions».pptx" files!


## Outlook
Alexa could try to perform image captioning. Caption generation is a challenging artificial intelligence problem where a textual description must be generated for a given photograph. 

## Reproducibility
Set up the Python environment according to [this manual in section 1.1](https://www.evernote.com/l/Ai8y0xsAAV9BY7SFOiuwCkBB-bYRfGdT9wE/). 

## Hint
One must save the juptyer notebook ("__Jupyter Notebook Object Detection Tag Sunny vs. Cloudy__.ipynb") models named "mask_rcnn_coco.h5" and "model_fine_tuned.h5" on her/his own due to Github size limits.
